    "# Thermal Building Optimization Exercise III: **Two-Zone Building with Gable Roof**\n",
    "\n",
    "The building now consists of two thermal zones:\n",
    "1.  **`zone_habitable_1` (Ground Floor):** The main zone, actively heated/cooled (as in Exercises I & II).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`zone_habitable_2` (Attic/Ceiling Space):** A new, **unheated/uncooled zone** .\n",
    "\n",
    "The flat roof has been replaced by a **gable (two-slope) roof structure**. Your primary goal remains to minimize the total energy consumption of the **heated zone 1**, but this is now influenced by heat transfer through the slab separating the two zones and the unconditioned attic.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of this exercise, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Analyze Glazing Impact:** Quantify the trade-off between heat losses (conduction) and solar gains (radiation) through transparent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Optimize Glazing Distribution:** Determine the optimal Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) distribution across façades based on building orientation and climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Integrate Design Decisions:** Assess how glazing properties (`UWindow`) and area interact with the building's thermal inertia (opaque envelope from Exercise I).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. New Building Elements and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Roof Geometry and Glazing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gable Roof Inclination:** The roof consists of two panels whose inclination angle, **`IncRoof` (in degrees)**, can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Shallow Roof (Low Angle):** Test values around **$10^\\circ$ to $15^\\circ$**. A shallow roof provides a smaller roof surface area exposed to the environment but can reduce heat gain via solar radiation in winter compared to a steep slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Steep Roof (High Angle):** Test values around **$40^\\circ$ to $50^\\circ$**. A steep roof increases the surface area of the vertical gable walls and the roof panels themselves but can increase solar gain in winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Roof Windows:** Two new windows (`window_1_floor_2` and `window_2_floor_2`) are introduced on the roof panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Window Area Constraint:** The area of each window (both on the façade and on the roof) must be strictly **smaller** than the total area of the surface it is attached to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inter-Zone Slab\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **ceiling slab** (`slab_floor_2`) separates the heated zone (`zone_habitable_1`) from the unheated attic zone (`zone_habitable_2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The properties of this slab (thickness: `eIntSlab`, `eExtSlab`, etc.) are important, as they determine the heat transfer between the two zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometric and Opaque Material Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "* **All constraints from Exercise I remain active** (Area=$100\\,\\text{m}^2$, $2.7 \\le height \\le 3.0\\,\\text{m}$, $\\text{Thickness} \\le 0.40\\,\\text{m}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* For this exercise, use the **optimized opaque envelope design** (wall materials and orientation) determined in Exercise I as your starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Assignment: Two-Zone Optimization Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to find the overall optimal design by balancing the heat losses/gains from the exterior envelope (walls, roof, windows) with the heat exchange between the two zones via the slab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Investigation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Final Opaque and Glazing Baseline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Start with the **optimized façade design** (Wall thickness, orientation, and window sizes/U-value) determined in Exercises I and II.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set an initial `IncRoof` (e.g., $30^\\circ$).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Slab Optimization (Inter-Zone Barrier):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The slab is important as it separates the conditioned zone (1) from the environment of the unheated attic (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Insulation vs. Inertia:** Determine the optimal material properties for the slab (`eSlab`, $\\lambda S\\text{lab}$, $\\rho S\\text{lab}$) to minimize heat loss/gain from Zone 1. Should the slab prioritize **insulation** (low $\\lambda$) or **thermal inertia** (high $\\rho$)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Roof Geometry and Window Optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Vary `IncRoof`:** Investigate the impact of a shallow roof vs. a steep roof on total energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Roof Glazing:** Since Zone 2 is unheated, placing windows on the roof panels (Window 5 & 6) can affect the **temperature swing** of the attic space. Determine the optimal size and U-value for these roof windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Insulation vs. Inertia:** Determine the optimal material properties for the roof (`eRoof`, $\\lambda S\\text{lab}$, $\\rho S\\text{lab}$) to minimize heat loss/gain from Zone 1. Should the roof prioritize **insulation** (low $\\lambda$) or **thermal inertia** (high $\\rho$)? How does it correlate to slab material choice (Insulated roof with high inertia slab or both well insulated, or high inertia roof with well insulated slab)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Analysis:** Compare `building.zone_habitable_1.TAir` (heated) with `building.zone_habitable_2.TAir` (unheated) (Graph 1) to understand how the attic temperature acts as a thermal buffer (or a heat sink/source).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Final Synthesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Propose the ultimate design combining your findings from all three exercises (Geometry, Opaque Walls, Façade Glazing, Slab, and Gable Roof).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final configuration must adhere to **all geometric and material constraints** (including the new window area limits).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final configuration must **minimize `energyConsumptionTotal`** over the simulation period.\n"
