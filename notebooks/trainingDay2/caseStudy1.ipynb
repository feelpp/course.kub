    "1.  **Analyze Building Physics:** Understand the relationship between **thermal inertia** (heavy vs. light materials) placement and building performance under transient conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Evaluate Envelope Design:** Quantify the influence of **geometry, orientation, and surface absorptivity** on solar gains and heat losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Optimize Energy Consumption:** Determine the most effective strategies (material choice, air change rate, insulation thickness) to minimize HVAC energy demand (`energyConsumptionTotal`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Interpret Simulation Results:** Connect the physical phenomena (conduction, convection, radiation) to the simulated heat fluxes (Graph 5) and coefficients (Graph 4).\n",

    "### Geometric Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ground Floor Area:** Must be $100 \\, \\text{m}^2$.\n",
    "    * $LengthWall1 \\times LengthWall2 = 100 \\, \\text{m}^2$\n",
    "* **Height:** Must be between $2.7 \\, \\text{m}$ and $3.0 \\, \\text{m}$.\n",

    "    * The wall-to-azimuth mapping is constrained in the FMU by the azimuth of wall1 in order to form a box shaped building :\n",

    "        * `wall_2_floor_1`: `azimuthWall1` $+ 90^\\circ$ (West)\n",
    "        * `wall_3_floor_1`: `azimuthWall1` $+ 180^\\circ$ (North)\n",
    "        * `wall_4_floor_1`: `azimuthWall1` $+ 270^\\circ$ (East)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Material and Construction Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Layer Structure:** Every opaque element (Walls, Roof, Bottom) must consist of **two layers**: an interior (`Int`) and an exterior (`Ext`) layer.\n",
    "    * You must use **one heavy material** (high $\\rho$) and **one light material** (low $\\rho$) for the two layers of each element using the provided dictionary of materials.\n",

    "## 2. Assignment: Optimization Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main goal is to find the combination of parameters that leads to the **lowest `energyConsumptionTotal`** over the simulation period, while maintaining thermal comfort ($T_{setHeating} = 20^\\circ\\text{C}$, $T_{setCooling} = 24^\\circ\\text{C}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Investigation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Baseline Simulation:**\n",
    "    * Choose starting values (e.g., $L_1=10, L_2=10, h=3, \\text{azimuth}=0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set initial Power Limits (`coolingPower`, `heatingPower`) for the ideal loads (Graph 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Monitor:** `energyConsumptionTotal` and `building.zone_habitable_1.TAir` (Graph 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Exterior Surface and Orientation Study:**\n",
    "    * **Vary `azimuthWall1`** (e.g., $0^\\circ, 90^\\circ, 180^\\circ$) to analyze solar exposure.\n",
    "    * **Test the extremes of Absorptivity** (`absWallX`, `absRoof`) in relation to the wall's orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * **Low $\\alpha$ (e.g., $0.2$):** Typical for light, reflective surfaces.\n",
    "        * **High $\\alpha$ (e.g., $0.9$):** Typical for dark, non-reflective surfaces.\n",
    "    * **Analysis:** Observe the impact on solar heat gain by comparing `building.surfacesToAmbience.surface[x].toSurfacesPort.heatPortSw.Q_flow` (Solar Radiation) for walls (Graph 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Material and Thermal Inertia Study:**\n",
    "    * **Thermal Inertia Placement:** Compare the effects of placing the **heavy material** (high $\\rho$) on the **interior** (high thermal inertia) versus the **exterior** layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Material Choice:** Optimize the thermal conductivity ($\\lambda$) and density ($\\rho$) of the two layers for each element (Wall, Roof, Bottom).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Analysis:** Monitor the **Conduction flux** (`building.wall_x_floor_x.construction.heatPort_x2.Q_flow`) for a wall (Graph 5) to see how quickly heat penetrates the construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Air and Ground Study:**\n",
    "    * **Air Tightness:** Compare energy consumption for **Low** vs **High** values of `airChange`.\n",
    "        * **Low `airChange` ($0.2 \\, \\text{AC/h}$):** Airtight building.\n",
    "        * **High `airChange` ($1.0 \\, \\text{AC/h}$):** Leaky building.\n",
    "    * **Ground Coupling:** Test the impact of varying `Tground.T` (Ground Temperature, input in Kelvin) on the required energy.\n",
    "        * **Low `Tground.T` ($273.15 + 6^\\circ\\text{C}$):** Representative of winter ground conditions.\n",
    "        * **High `Tground.T` ($273.15 + 15^\\circ\\text{C}$):** Representative of summer ground conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Heat Fluxes (Graph 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay close attention to the **sign convention** when analyzing the fluxes (Graph 5):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Positive Fluxes** ($Q_{flow}$) typically indicate heat **entering** the wall or the zone.\n",
    "* **Negative Fluxes** ($Q_{flow}$) typically indicate heat **leaving** the wall or the zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Fluxes to Focus On:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `building.surfacesToAmbience.surface[x].toConstructionPort.heatPort.Q_flow`: This is the **total heat flux** exchanged between the exterior surface and the environment (Sum of Convection, Solar Radiation, and Longwave Radiation on the exterior face).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `building.wall_x_floor_x.construction.heatPort_x2.Q_flow`: This represents the heat **conduction** across the exterior layer, which drives the heat into or out of the building envelope mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final configuration must adhere to **all geometric and material constraints**.\n",
    "* The final configuration must **minimize `energyConsumptionTotal`** over the simulation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep a comparison of `energyConsumptionTotal` between your initial baseline simulation and the final optimized result.\n"
